# Python Automations

## Overview

This repository contains a growing collection of practical Python scripts designed to automate everyday tasks.

Each script is modular, well-documented, and uses Python's standard library wherever possible â€” making them lightweight, secure, and easy to run.

## Scripts Included




| Script                          | Description                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| disk_usage_email_alert.py      | Sends email if disk usage exceeds threshold |
| backup_folder.py               | Creates zip backups of target folder        |
| rename_bulk_files.py           | Renames files in bulk using custom pattern  |

As new scripts are added, this table will grow to showcase automation examples across system monitoring, file handling, reporting, and more.
